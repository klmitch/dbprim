Sparse matrices \- 
.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Sparse matrices are advanced data structures used to represent associations. For instance, a manager may have several employees, but several of those employees may report to more than one manager. (Yes, this is a contrived example, so sue me.) The simplest way to represent such assocations is with a matrix, or a two-dimensional array. However, such an implementation cannot easily be extended dynamically--imagine if a manager retires and two more are hired, for instance. It would also use an enormous amount of memory, as most employees would only report to one or two managers.
.PP
A sparse matrix solves this problem by only allocating memory for the cells in the full matrix which are actually used. That is, no memory is allocated to represent Alice reporting to Bob unless Alice actually does report to Bob. This is a simple concept, but fairly difficult to implement efficiently--how do you tell if Alice reports to Bob? The solution utilized by this library is to combine the strengths of linked lists and hash tables. Each cell is in two linked lists, rooted at the rows and columns of the matrix, but a hash table is used when attempting to look up a given cell. If the cell is allocated, then there will be an entry in the hash table, and finding the given cell is as fast as a hash table look-up.
.PP
Because sparse matrices are so complicated, there are three structures and a variety of operations used. Two of the structures, \fBsmat_table_t\fP and \fBsmat_head_t\fP, are caller-allocated. However, the third structure, \fBsmat_entry_t\fP, must be allocated by the library. To avoid too much overhead from malloc(), a free list is used. The free list may be managed with the \fBsmat_cleanup()\fP and \fBsmat_freemem()\fP calls.
.PP
The \fBsmat_table_t\fP contains the hash table. Only one of these need be allocated per type of association--for instance, in the above example, only one \fBsmat_table_t\fP needs to be allocated to represent the manager-employee relationship.
.PP
The \fBsmat_head_t\fP contains the linked list. There are actually two kinds of these structures--one is \fBSMAT_LOC_FIRST\fP, which could be regarded as a ``row,'' and the other is \fBSMAT_LOC_SECOND\fP, which could be regarded as a ``column.'' Which one is used for which type of data is irrelevant, as long as consistency is maintained. For the above example, a \fBsmat_head_t\fP for a manager may be \fBSMAT_LOC_FIRST\fP, and one for an employee must then be \fBSMAT_LOC_SECOND\fP. (These values are set when initializing the \fBsmat_head_t\fP structure.)
.PP
An association may be created with the \fBst_add()\fP function, which allows an arbitrary ordering in the associated linked lists by the same mechanism as for the linked list component of the library. An association may be removed with \fBst_remove()\fP, or looked up with \fBst_find()\fP. If iteration over all associations is desired, use the \fBst_iter()\fP function. Removing all associations from a table may be performed with \fBst_flush()\fP, which optionally calls a user-defined clean-up function. The associated hash table may be resized with \fBst_resize()\fP, and the bucket table may be released with \fBst_free()\fP.
.PP
An association may also be reordered within the linked lists using the \fBsh_move()\fP function. If a particular entry is desired, use the \fBsh_find()\fP function with a user-defined comparison function to locate it. Iteration may be performed with the \fBsh_iter()\fP function, and all entries in a given linked list may be removed with the sh_flush() function, which again may optionally call a user-defined clean-up function.
