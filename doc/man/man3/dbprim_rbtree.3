Red-black trees \- 
.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Red-black trees are a form of binary search tree. One essential feature of binary search trees is that they need to be balanced in order to be efficient. Many algorithms exist for keeping trees balanced, but among the easiest to implement is the red-black tree. In a red-black tree, every node is given a color--either red or black--and there are various rules for what color nodes can be present where in the tree. This library implements these rules, along with functions for traversing the tree in any desired tree order.
.PP
A red-black tree is represented by a caller-allocated \fBrb_tree_t\fP structure. This structure describes various characteristics of the tree, such as the number of nodes in the tree, and includes a pointer to the root node of the tree. Nodes may be added to the tree using \fBrt_add()\fP or removed from the tree using \fBrt_remove()\fP. Additionally, the key on a given node may be changed using the \fBrt_move()\fP function. Nodes may be looked up with \fBrt_find()\fP, and \fBrt_iter()\fP will execute a user-defined function for each node in the tree in the specified order. To remove all entries in the tree, simply call the \fBrt_flush()\fP function. If you must manually iterate through the tree, you may call the \fBrt_next()\fP and \fBrt_prev()\fP functions to determine the next or previous nodes to visit.
.PP
There are three ways to traverse a binary tree. The first, known as 'preorder,' visits the root node, then traverses the left subtree in preorder, then traverses the right subtree in preorder. The second, known an 'inorder,' traverses the left subtree in inorder, then the root node, then the right subtree in inorder. (This particular ordering retrieves the nodes in lexical order; thus its name.) The third ordering is known as 'postorder'; this ordering traverses the left subtree, the right subtree, then visits the root node. To iterate over the tree in one of these orderings, simply call \fBrt_iter()\fP (or \fBrt_next()\fP or \fBrt_prev()\fP) with the \fBRBT_ORDER_PRE\fP, \fBRBT_ORDER_IN\fP, or \fBRBT_ORDER_POST\fP flags. You may OR these flags with \fBDB_FLAG_REVERSE\fP to reverse the traversal ordering, if you wish.

.PP
This function obtains the next node in the given iteration scheme. The \fCnode_io\fP parameter is a value-result parameter--if the node pointer to which it points is \fCNULL\fP, the first node for the given iteration order will be loaded; otherwise, the next node in the given iteration order will be loaded.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fItree\fP A pointer to a \fBrb_tree_t\fP. 
.br
\fInode_io\fP A pointer to a pointer to a \fBrb_node_t\fP. If the pointer to which node_io points is \fCNULL\fP, the first node will be loaded, otherwise the next node will be loaded. 
.br
\fIflags\fP One of RBT_ORDER_PRE, RBT_ORDER_IN, or RBT_ORDER_POST, possibly ORed with DB_FLAG_REVERSE to reverse the order of iteration. Zero is not allowed.
